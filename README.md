# 💊 Medicine Interaction Checker

An AI-powered full-stack web application that helps users check potential interactions between multiple medications using advanced natural language processing.


## 🎯 Project Overview

This application was developed as part of my internship application for **Cambio Software**, demonstrating proficiency in:
- **Frontend:** React.js with modern hooks and component architecture
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot with RESTful API design
- **AI Integration:** Claude AI for intelligent medicine search
- **Healthcare Domain:** Understanding of medical data and drug interactions

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **AI-Powered Smart Search**
- Natural language understanding (e.g., "painkiller" → finds Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen)
- Typo tolerance (e.g., "asprin" → finds "Aspirin")
- Contextual medicine suggestions based on user queries

### 2. **Real-Time Interaction Checking**
- Automatically checks for drug interactions when multiple medicines are selected
- Color-coded severity levels:
  - 🔴 **Severe:** Critical interactions requiring immediate medical attention
  - 🟡 **Moderate:** Caution required, consult healthcare provider
  - 🟢 **Minor/Safe:** No significant interactions detected

### 3. **Intuitive User Interface**
- Clean, modern design with smooth animations
- Responsive layout for all devices
- User-friendly medicine selection and removal
- Clear interaction warnings with detailed recommendations
